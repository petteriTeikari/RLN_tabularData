Using the [irashavitt/regularization_learning_networks](https://github.com/irashavitt/regularization_learning_networks) repository described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.06440 "Regularization Learning Networks: Deep Learning for Tabular Datasets

## Regression

Run the 'demo_RLN_original.py' for a regression problem (using the `boston_housing` dataset) which should give you MSEs around 24.
